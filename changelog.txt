Version: 0.8.6
Date: 2024-12-30
  Features:
    - The mod now generates refining recipes for items that are derived only from fluids
  Balancing:
    - Refining time calculation now prefers walking through production chain that has the least amount of fluids. This fixes base alternate recipes involving molten iron/copper being picked
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed possible crashes where recipes with energy_required as nil get wrongly picked up
    - Fixed plastic bar and ice having absurdly low refining time
    - Fixed solid fuel, scrap and uranium ore being able to be refined
    - Fixed refining time for base items getting set more than once
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.5
Date: 2024-12-29
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed plates coming from smelting recipes improperly having double the refining time they're supposed to
    - Fixed Lithium reverting back to autogenerated refining time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.4
Date: 2024-12-29
  Features:
    - The mod now automatically recognizes recipes from entities that spawn items out of "thin air"
    - All modded science packs now have a default refining time of 5 seconds
    - Modded smelting recipes now contribute to overall end product refining time
    - Other mods can now opt-out or set their own complexity for an item
  Changes:
    - Mod should no longer crash on startup when it sees an incompatible circular dependency
  Balancing:
    - Probabilities are now considered when calculating refining time
    - Wood can now be refined
    - Refining time for ammo has changed, since it's now automatically generated
    - The mod will now also artificially inflate any new modded ammo items
    - Pentapod egg, Biter egg and Raw fish now have the same 75s refining time
    - Asteroid chunks now all have the same refining time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.1
Date: 2024-12-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Properly copy required science ingredients for Refinery technology, fixing compatibility with atan-nuclear-science (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/promethium-quality/discussion/676fbcd31673236545d810d1)
