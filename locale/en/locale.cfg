refinery-input-slot-tooltip=Item to be refined
refinery-input-slot-restricted=Item can't be refined! Make sure you have [fluid=promethium-emulsion] in machine

[mod-setting-name]
debug-refining-graph=Debug refining graph
promethium-chunk-spoil-time=Promethium chunk spoil time (hr)
refining-hardness=Refining hardness (%)
refining-lean=Refining lean (%)
refining-time-multiplier=Refining time multiplier (%)
refining-default-science-pack-time=Refining modded science pack time (s)

[mod-setting-description]
debug-refining-graph=Enabling will output the thought process of refining time calculation to factorio-current.log - its only purpose is for you to check why a specific (modded) item is not refinable
promethium-chunk-spoil-time=Set to 0 to disable spoiling effect completely
refining-hardness=Global multiplier to perceived "complexity" of items, which is later affected by "Refining lean". Higher means more refining time
refining-lean=Higher gives more bias to complex items, making their refining time lower than it should be
refining-time-multiplier=Global multiplier for refining time. Not affected by lean. Higher means more refining time
refining-default-science-pack-time=All science packs have hardcoded refining time. This sets default refining time for modded science packs that haven't been set by the mod itself

[item-name]
refinery=Refinery

[fluid-name]
promethium-emulsion=Promethium emulsion

[item-description]
refinery=Upgrades an item's quality at no resource cost. Refining time depends on the item's complexity; all ingredients in the chain contribute.
promethium-asteroid-chunk=An asteroid chunk found when approaching the shattered planet. Its delicate structure is temporary and constantly deteriorating once collected.

refining=__1__ refining
promethium-chunk-melting=Melting promethium asteroid chunk
promethium-chunk-submerging=Submerging promethium asteroid chunk

[technology-description]
refinery=You realize the properties of [item=promethium-asteroid-chunk] can subtly improve the quality of your machines' components. The next logical step was to think of ways to industrialize its usage...
