refinery-input-slot-tooltip=Item to be refined
refinery-input-slot-restricted=Item or one of the previous ingredients can't be refined!

[mod-setting-name]
debug-refining-graph=Debug refining graph
promethium-chunk-spoil-time=Promethium chunk spoil time (hr)
refining-hardness=Refining hardness (%)
refining-lean=Refining lean (%)
refining-time-multiplier=Refining time multiplier (%)
refining-time-max=Refining time maximum (min)
refining-default-science-pack-time=Refining modded science pack time (s)
refinery-allow-quality=Allow quality effect on Refinery
refinery-auto-set-input-filter=Blacklist highest quality on input

[mod-setting-description]
debug-refining-graph=Enabling will output the thought process of refining time calculation to factorio-current.log - its only purpose is for you to check why a specific (modded) item is not refinable
promethium-chunk-spoil-time=If enabled with > 0 hr, promethium asteroid chunks will spoil to oxides
refining-hardness=Global multiplier to perceived "complexity" of items, which is later affected by "Refining lean". Higher means more refining time
refining-lean=Higher gives more bias to complex items, making their refining time lower than it should be
refining-time-multiplier=Global multiplier for refining time. Not affected by lean. Higher means more refining time
refining-time-max=Puts hard cap to refining time for any item. Set to 0 to disable
refining-default-science-pack-time=All science packs have hardcoded refining time. This sets default refining time for modded science packs that haven't been set by the mod itself
refinery-allow-quality=Discouraged as the premise of upcycling at no cost is already overpowered
refinery-auto-set-input-filter=If enabled, newly placed inserters facing refinery will automatically have filter set to blacklist highest quality

[item-name]
refinery=Refinery

[fluid-name]
promethium-emulsion=Promethium slurry

[item-description]
refinery=Upgrades an item's quality at no resource cost. Refining time depends on the item's complexity; all ingredients in the chain contribute.

[fluid-description]
promethium-emulsion=Shredded shards of promethium asteroids suspended in liquid that contains its radioactive decay.

[entity-name]
refinery=Refinery

[entity-description]
refinery=Upgrades an item's quality at no resource cost. Refining time depends on the item's complexity; all ingredients in the chain contribute.

[recipe-name]
refining=__1__ refining
promethium-chunk-melting=Promethium slurry with lubricant
promethium-chunk-submerging=Promethium slurry with ammonia

[technology-name]
refinery=Refinery

[technology-description]
refinery=You realize that X-rays using promethium decay can be used to detect subtle imperfections in ingredients and machinery. The next obvious step is thinking of a way to automate fixing them...
